    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will implement linear regression and get to see it work on data. Before starting on this programming exercise, we strongly recommend watching the video lectures and completing the review questions for the associated topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the information you need for solving this assignment is in this notebook, and all the code you will be implementing will take place within this notebook. The assignment can be promptly submitted to the coursera grader directly from this notebook (code and instructions are included below).\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin with the exercises, we need to import all libraries required for this programming exercise. Throughout the course, we will be using [`numpy`](http://www.numpy.org/) for all arrays and matrix operations, and [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/) for plotting.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find instructions on how to install required libraries in the README file in the [github repository](https://github.com/dibgerge/ml-coursera-python-assignments)."

    "## Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some things to keep in mind throughout this exercise:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python array indices start from zero, not one (contrary to OCTAVE/MATLAB). \n",
    "\n",
    "- There is an important distinction between python arrays (called `list` or `tuple`) and `numpy` arrays. You should use `numpy` arrays in all your computations. Vector/matrix operations work only with `numpy` arrays. Python lists do not support vector operations (you need to use for loops).\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you are seeing many errors at runtime, inspect your matrix operations to make sure that you are adding and multiplying matrices of compatible dimensions. Printing the dimensions of `numpy` arrays using the `shape` property will help you debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "- By default, `numpy` interprets math operators to be element-wise operators. If you want to do matrix multiplication, you need to use the `dot` function in `numpy`. For, example if `A` and `B` are two `numpy` matrices, then the matrix operation AB is `np.dot(A, B)`. Note that for 2-dimensional matrices or vectors (1-dimensional), this is also equivalent to `A@B` (requires python >= 3.5)."

    "\n",
    "Before starting on any task, it is often useful to understand the data by visualizing it. For this dataset, you can use a scatter plot to visualize the data, since it has only two properties to plot (profit and population). Many other problems that you will encounter in real life are multi-dimensional and cannot be plotted on a 2-d plot. There are many plotting libraries in python (see this [blog post](https://blog.modeanalytics.com/python-data-visualization-libraries/) for a good summary of the most popular ones). \n",

    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n",
    "You might have noticed that we have imported the `pyplot` module at the beginning of this exercise using the command `from matplotlib import pyplot`. This is rather uncommon, and if you look at python code elsewhere or in the `matplotlib` tutorials, you will see that the module is named `plt`. This is used by module renaming by using the import command `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`. We will not using the short name of `pyplot` module in this class exercises, but you should be aware of this deviation from norm.\n",

Keep in mind that the cost $J(\\theta)$ is parameterized by the vector $\\theta$, not $X$ and $y$. That is, we minimize the value of $J(\\theta)$ by changing the values of the vector $\\theta$, not by changing $X$ or $y$. [Refer to the equations in this notebook](#section2) and to the video lectures if you are uncertain. A good way to verify that gradient descent is working correctly is to look at the value of $J(\\theta)$ and check that it is decreasing with each step. \n",

    "- For matrix-vector multiplication, so if $X$ is a $m\\times n$ matrix and $y$ is a vector of length $m$, then the operation `np.dot(y, X)` considers $y$ as a $1 \\times m$ vector. On the other hand, if $y$ is a vector of length $n$, then the operation `np.dot(X, y)` considers $y$ as a $n \\times 1$ vector.\n",
